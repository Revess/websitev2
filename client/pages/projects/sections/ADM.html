        With the current state of AI music being impressive, but still not at its full capacity. Two factors are
        supposed culprits of this: audio quality and the speed of generating for live settings. The lack of stereo
        information and the struggle to retain phase information correctly are the culprits of this problem, the
        algorithms are computationally heavy and slow. This study aims to improve these problems and make the music more
        applicable so it can be used for a general audience. In this paper two options are proposed: A different
        interpretation to create datasets for GAN and using LSTM algorithms for generating data while playing the music
        live. By giving GAN algorithms both the complex and real domain during training for the entire stereo image the
        GAN converges way better with recreating this data. To test its applicability to a general audience, a group 53
        participants were asked to identify 20 pieces of audio within 10 questions (so two samples per question). The
        group could give the audio either the label AI or Human. As a result, the group who did not have a musical
        background (playing or composing) and the ones who did not listen to instrumental music as often were not as
        able to recognize the difference between an AI or Human. The question is whether AI currently could replace
        human music. Concluding I would like to suggest a new genre as a result of this research: Algorithmic Dance
        Music. Since AI music is difficult to recreate as a human, due to the way frequencies are represented over time.
        ADM could be a new cultural movement where AI lives alongside human music.
