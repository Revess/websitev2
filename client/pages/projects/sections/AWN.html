        In collaboration with the Archeological Work Group Netherlands and Lars Bijleveld I do
        research on automatization to identify of historical findings. With Artificial Intelligence we
        want to create tools for archeologists so they can focus on what is important, the story behind
        the objects rather than the administrative tasks like; indexing and analyzing.
      </p>
      <p style="overflow:auto;text-overflow: ellipsis;">
        By using the latest and greatest image recognization algorithm the AI will be able to
        distinguise clearly between different archeological findings.
        The training data is made up of real archeological findings, 2D sketches of the original shards
        and 3D moddeled pots that are virtually broken and then photographed.
        This algorithm will be transformed into a tool any archeologist will be able to use anywhere at any time.
      </p>
      <p style="overflow:auto;text-overflow: ellipsis;">
        Alongside the research in Artificial Intelligence we are creating a exposition about the
        process of the AI. We will show all its ins and outs, to make it as clear as possible for
        anyone that is interested in the project.
